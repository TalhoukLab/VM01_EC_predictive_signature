# Discovery of an integrative signature for vaginal 16S rRNA microbiome to predict endometrial cancer 

In this work, we used previously published 16S rRNA data in the context of EC. First, we assess the reproducibility and replicability of the bioinformatics processing used in identified published studies and propose a pipeline that can recapitulate the microbiome signatures from each available data. Next, we employ two frameworks to integrate microbiome data from multiple centers, develop a model, and make predictions about EC status in a held-out dataset. We account for available confounding factors such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), ethnicity, and vaginal pH, all of which are known to influencerisk of developing EC and alter the composition of the vaginal microbiome. Our results show that microbiome data has strong potential to be used for early detection of EC.
