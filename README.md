# Vaginal Microbiome: Reproducbility, Replicability, and State-Of-The-Art pipeline 

This project aims to evalaute the reproducbility and replicability of five studies that identify a vaginal microbiome signature for endometrial cancer. We also introduce a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) pipeline that improves the reprodubility of publsihed studies.
